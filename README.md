# Wreck-it-Ralph-Game-Project
A game project made for the DIO bootcamp

Some upgrades i did on the game comparing to the original made in the challenge:

1 - I stilyzed the game a bit more.

2 - I've add the losing life after missing the hit.

3 - Create a level menu:

3.1 - if the player makes 5 points, the game speed up a bit;

3.2 - And another 10 seconds is added in the current time left.
